## ⚙️ Steps Followed

### 1. **Data Collection & Import**
- Imported raw loan data into **MS SQL Server** for cleaning and analysis.

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation (SQL)**
- Removed duplicates and handled null values.  
- Standardized **loan status** fields and formatted date columns.  
- Classified loans into **Good** and **Bad** categories based on repayment behavior.

### 3. **Data Analysis & Querying (SQL)**
- Extracted key metrics:
  - **Total Loans**, **Funded Amount**, **Interest Rate**, **Debt-to-Income (DTI)**.
- Performed **monthly, quarterly, and yearly** trend analysis.

### 4. **Data Modeling & Transformation (Power BI)**
- Connected **Power BI** to the SQL Server database.  
- Created **relationships** between tables and used **Power Query** for ETL and transformations.

### 5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI & DAX)**
- Built **interactive visualizations** for:
  - Loan trends  
  - Borrower risk  
  - Regional insights  
- Used **DAX formulas** to create KPIs such as:
  - **Month-over-Month (MoM)** growth  
  - **Month-to-Date (MTD)** changes
